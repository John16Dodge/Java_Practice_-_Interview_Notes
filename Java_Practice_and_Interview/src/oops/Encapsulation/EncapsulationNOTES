Definition: Encapsulation is about bundling data (variables) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit, a class. It hides the internal state of an object 
            and protects data from being directly accessed or modified from outside the class.
            
           
EXAMPLE CODE :
 
public class Employee {
    // Private data variable
    private double salary;

    // Public setter method to control access
    public void setSalary(double newSalary) {
        if (newSalary > 0) { // We can add validation logic here
            this.salary = newSalary;
        }
    }
    
    // Public getter method to read data
    public double getSalary() {
        return salary;
    }
}
