Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass) can inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass). This promotes code reuse and establishes an "is-a" relationship, like a "Dog" is an "Animal."

// Superclass
class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("This animal eats food.");
    }
}

// Subclass inheriting from Animal
class Dog extends Animal {
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("The dog barks.");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog();
        myDog.eat(); // Inherited from Animal
        myDog.bark(); // Specific to Dog
    }
}

INTERVIEW QUESTIONS : 
1. What is Inheritance? 🤔
Answer: Inheritance is an OOP mechanism where one class (subclass or child class) can inherit properties and behaviors from another class (superclass or parent class). It creates an "is-a" relationship, like "a car is a vehicle."

2. What is the main benefit of using Inheritance? 🚀
Answer: The primary benefit is code reusability. It allows a subclass to reuse code from a superclass, reducing redundancy and making the code easier to maintain.

3. How do you implement Inheritance in Java? ✍️
Answer: You use the extends keyword. For example, class Dog extends Animal means the Dog class inherits from the Animal class.

4. What is the difference between extends and implements? الفرق بينهما
Answer:

extends is used for inheritance between classes. It establishes an "is-a" relationship. A class can only extend one other class.

implements is used to make a class adhere to a specific interface. A class can implement multiple interfaces.

5. What is Method Overriding? How is it related to Inheritance? 🔄
Answer: Method overriding is when a subclass provides its own specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This is a core concept of polymorphism that relies on inheritance to work. The method signature (name and parameters) must be the same in both classes.
