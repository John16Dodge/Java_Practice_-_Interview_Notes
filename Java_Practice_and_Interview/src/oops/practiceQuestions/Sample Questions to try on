Problem: Student Management System
Design a simple Student Management System using OOP principles. Your system should be able to manage different types of students and calculate their grades.

Requirements:

Encapsulation: Create a base Student class with private attributes for name, id, and a list of grades. Provide public methods to set and get these attributes.

Inheritance: Create two subclasses, UndergraduateStudent and GraduateStudent, that inherit from the Student class.

Polymorphism: The Student class should have an abstract method called calculateGPA(). Each subclass should provide its own implementation of this method. UndergraduateStudent should calculate GPA on a scale of 4.0, while GraduateStudent should calculate GPA on a scale of 5.0.

Abstraction: Use an abstract class for the Student base class to enforce that all student types must have a calculateGPA() method.
